Vacuum Energy, Gravity and Annihilation (VEGA) game is a survival game.

Ancient civilisations are facing extinction due to the shift of laws of physics. Massive vacuum energy oscilations started to occur due to unknown reasons creating enormous amounts of matter and antimatter. Some of it annihilates instantly but the laws of physics changed in a way that more antimatter is created than matter. The islands of antimatter started forming new stars. These can interact through gravity with stars made of matter where ancient civilisations live. If antimatter stars finally reach worlds of ancient civilisations, all the life will be annihilated.

Ancient civilisations have very little time to act. Some of the smartest ones invented a command center which can create more matter from vaccuum energy and form new stars from it. This can possibly repel the upcoming front of antimatter stars. When both matter and antimetter stars collide, they will explode in enormous amount of energy. While that happens far away, ancient civilisations can live safe.

But for how long this shield can hold and how long the ancient civilisations can fight against the mother nature?
