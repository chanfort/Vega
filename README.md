# VEGA game project

This project contains a 2D shooter game which uses self-gravity in 2D space. The self-gravity calculations on particles are computationally expensive to calculate. So Unity DOTS is used to run self-gravity calculations.

These scenes are available to play:
- Single Player - One player fights against AI.
- 2 vs AI - Two players working together when fighting AI. One player controls are WASD and another player uses arrow keys.
- P vs P - One player fights with another player. WASD and arrows keys for controls.
- DotsTest - This scene is for testing purposes only to see how switching self-gravity between DOTS and traditional modes are affecting the framerate.
